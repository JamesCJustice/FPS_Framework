# FPS

This project is a continuation/port from a [previous project](https://github.com/justi1jc/FPS)
developed with Unity3D. I've learned quite a few lessons in project management
and programming in general. Though I'll have a learning curve to picking up
Godot 3.0, I have chosen it for its license and the capabilities of its
3d engine.

## Roadmap



# Development
The work flow for this project will likely conform to the following process.
1 Create Epic with stories and tasks.
2 Create feature branch from develop
3 Complete tasks
4 Assess/test/debug stories, then merge feature branch to develop.
5 Repeat until next update.


Epics and their components are to be stored in separate text files and marked
complete when finished.
### Current task(s)
* None

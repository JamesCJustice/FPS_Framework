# FPS_Project

FPS_Project is exactly what the name implies. The intent is to create a first-person multiplayer game
with which to experiment. An MIT license will ensure that others curious about making their own FPS can
use this project as a starting point or a code reference. As this project matures, a thought of selling
a polished deliverable as a product will be considered. The game engine used will be Godot 3.0 with C# 
as the scripting language of choice.

This project is a departure from a [previous project](https://github.com/justi1jc/FPS), which was an attempt
to recreate common FPS game mechanics using Unity3d.

# Development 

The Release Arena_0.0.1 release branch serves as a starting point for
those interested in using Godot to make simple FPS games.

With the basic architecture in place for FPS gameplay and networking, 
the FPS_Project will undergo planning for the next steps in development.

See Planning/README.md on develop or feature branches for more details about the current state of development.

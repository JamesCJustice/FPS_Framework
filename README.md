# FPS_Project

FPS_Project is exactly what the name implies. The intent is to create a first-person multiplayer game
with which to experiment. An MIT license will ensure that others curious about making their own FPS can
use this project as a starting point or a code reference. As this project matures, a thought of selling
a polished deliverable as a product will be considered. The game engine used will be Godot 3.0 with C# 
as the scripting language of choice.

This project is a departure from a [previous project](https://github.com/justi1jc/FPS), which was an attempt
to recreate common FPS game mechanics using Unity3d.

# Development 

The 1.1.0 release includes some additional features not present in 1.0.1 such as settings menu, arena configuration, and bots in multiplayer. An inventory menu now exists for equipping, stashing, and dropping items.

The next major milestone will be an Adventure gamemode centered around players exploring a persistant open world. 

See Planning/README.md on develop or feature branches for more granular information.

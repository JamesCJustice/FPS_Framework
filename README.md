# FPS_Project

FPS_Project is exactly what the name implies. The intent is to create a first-person multiplayer game
with which to experiment. The game engine used will be Godot 3.0 with C# as the scripting language of choice.

This project is a departure from a [previous project](https://github.com/justi1jc/FPS), which was an attempt
to recreate common FPS game mechanics using Unity3d.

Because Godot 3.0 and it's C# support is still new and buggy, development will be slow at first. As familiarity
with the engine, engine stability, and documentation improve, the rate of progress should as well.


# Development
Foregoing a Jira-styled workflow with user epics, stories, and tasks until
such a time as C# API becomes available for Godot and C# support is improved
beyond current state.

For now I'm honestly just going to make a bunch of feature branches 
throwing things at the wall to see what will stick.

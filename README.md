# FPS_Project

FPS_Project is exactly what the name implies. The intent is to create a first-person multiplayer game
with which to experiment. The game engine used will be Godot 3.0 with C# as the scripting language of choice.

This project is a departure from a [previous project](https://github.com/justi1jc/FPS), which was an attempt
to recreate common FPS game mechanics using Unity3d.

Because Godot 3.0 and it's C# support is still new and buggy, development will be slow at first. As familiarity
with the engine, engine stability, and documentation improve, the rate of progress should as well.


# Development
The work flow for this project will likely conform to the following process:
1. Create Epic(s) with stories and tasks.
2. Create feature branch from develop
3. Complete tasks
4. Assess/test/debug stories, then merge feature branch to develop.
5. Repeat until next update.

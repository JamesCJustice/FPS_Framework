# FPS

This project is a continuation/port from a [previous project](https://github.com/justi1jc/FPS)
developed with Unity3D. I've learned quite a few lessons in project management
and programming in general. Though I'll have a learning curve to picking up
Godot 3.0, I have chosen it for its license and the capabilities of its
3d engine.

## Roadmap

### Core[In Progress]
The first few epics will focus on delivering basic functionality such as 
menus, saving/loading, and basic FPS functionality such as movement and item
use. After this phase, general understanding of the game engine should be
acquired along with an approximate architecture with which to build subsequent
modules and functionality.
 
### Arena
Once the FPS can function within a basic capacity, the next stories will go into
adding an Arena gameMode wherein the player fights NPC characters in one of 
multiple static maps. Upon completion, basic combat and AI should be done and
available for testing via the Arena.

### Mission
With the completion of the Arena, a Mission mode will enter development. This
mode will deliver a progression of missions with objectives for the player to
complete. Completion of this stage should pave the way for quest creation and
provide a wider variety of assets.

### Adventure
The Adventure mode will provide a randomly-generated map to be loaded onto the
world piecemeal in a grid surrounding the player. NPCs will dispense quests that
can be completed for rewards and a dialogue system should allow for more
sophisticated objectives than found in the mission mode.

# Development
The work flow for this project will likely conform to the following process.
1 Create Epic with stories and tasks.
2 Create feature branch from develop
3 Complete tasks
4 Assess/test/debug stories, then merge feature branch to develop.
5 Repeat until next update.


Epics and their components are to be stored in separate text files and marked
complete when finished.
### Current task(s)
* None

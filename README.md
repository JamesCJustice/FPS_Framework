# FPS_Project

FPS_Project is exactly what the name implies. The intent is to create a first-person multiplayer game
with which to experiment. The game engine used will be Godot 3.0 with C# as the scripting language of choice.

This project is a departure from a [previous project](https://github.com/justi1jc/FPS), which was an attempt
to recreate common FPS game mechanics using Unity3d.

Because Godot 3.0 and it's C# support is still new, development will be slow at first. As familiarity
with the engine, engine stability, and documentation improve, the rate of progress should as well.



# Development 

The first step in development will be a multiplayer arena shooter with which to
gain familiarity with Godot and the design considerations of Networking.

Once feature/networked_game is merged, a few smaller feature branches will fill
fill out additional design considerations, after which a release branch will
be created to serve as a portfolio piece and provide a starting project for
others to fork.

With the basic architecture in place for FPS gameplay and networking, 
the FPS_Project will undergo planning for the next step in development.


See Planning/README.md for more details about the current feature branch.

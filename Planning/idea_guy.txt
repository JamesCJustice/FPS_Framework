game design more than coherent software requirements.



**********************************************************************
        Far-Out Features
**********************************************************************


**Kingdom**
Port in the Kingdom card game as a minigame.

**Crafting**
Create menu for turning ingrient items into product items.

**Building**
Allow Actors to convert collected resources into placeable structures.

**Dialogue system**
Allow players to traverse speech trees with NPCs with optional voiceovers.

**NPC trading**
Allow dialogue options to trigger trading menu.

**NPC Quests**

**Hunger/Thirst**
Require food/water to survive. Possible add auto-consume option with "You have
X days worth of supplies left" warnings to keep this from being tedious.

**Followers**
Allow player to have a couple NPC followers that maintain a distance from the
player, assist in combat, and help carry items.

**Squads**
Allow player to command a set of NPC squad leaders that each have minions.
Orders would include Move, Attack, Change Rules of Engagement, and Change Pace.

**Generate map**
Generate a 2D map of the world's terrain so that places that are not loaded 
can still be viewed in detail.

**Command map**
Use 2D map to set navpoints and view a squad's calculated path.

**Vehicles**
A vehicle would store an actor(possibly exposing their body to harm), offer
storage for items, and have some fancy physics to it. 


**********************Conservation of resources*********************************
This is the general idea that renewable resources can be created, but
non-renewable resources can only be found.

**Persistant world**
All Actors/Items/Buildings should persist in their current state. Nothing should
respawn nor despawn when a player is absent. Things do not need to remain 
stationary when left alone, however.

**NPC creation**
Actor should be able to pro-create to produce children(By living in the same
house/den) or venture in from a neighboring inaccessible territory.

**Skeletal world representation**
When unloaded, the world should update a minimal representation of each region
as a set of ecosystems(wandering Actors), and settlements/dens(Sedentary Actors).
Weighted random events and actions should decide resource production/harvest, 
population growth, the outcome of altercations, and the position of NPCs at any
given time.

********************Multiplayer*************************************************

**Multiplayer Sandbox*
Client-Server multiplayer would allow multiple clients to drop in and out of a
persistent world, as is the case in Minecraft.

**Local Co-op**
Player2 could join in using a gamepad. Player2 might play as a follower, squad
leader, or commander(giving orders from a map filled with info).

**Dual-screen multiplayer**
Give Player2 monitor 2, reducing screen-peeking and eliminating split-screen
issues.

**Online Arena Mode**
Standard matchmaking lobby->static map deathmatch arena with rounds. Gamemodes
could vary.

**Horde mode**
Team 1 fights against oncoming waves of NPCs commanded by
team 2. Each completed wave awards points to both sides. Team 1 uses points for
upgrades and turrets whilst team 2 purchases upgrades and additional NPCs.

Philosophy
********************************************************************************

** Naming **
A successful name is either short, or can be abbreviated or made into a 
phoenetic acronym. A more successful name captures some fundamental truth about
the game not only as a player experience, but also as a branding legacy.

Angle A
A common approach to naming is to fashion a compound word from a noun and 
descriptor. 

Nouns:
  Mana
  Magic
  Theatre( of war)
  

Descriptors
  Divine
  
Candidte name: manafest


** Pillars of gameplay **


Choice -
There should be a variety of valid play styles. Every problem should be as much
about choosing a solution as it is executing one. Pros/cons should balance each
solution so that it lends itself to a cohesive play style.

Procedural Story -
A fixed chain or tree of plot nodes allows fine-tailoring of cinematic experiences
using hand-crafted gameplay sequences. This project will not have access to the
labor nor creative talent required for such. More importantly, the AAA market
is heavily saturated with this scheme.

Instead, plot nodes should be defined in terms of objectives that can likewise
be pursued and achieved by both human players and NPCs. A campaign should consist
of a series of plot nodes leading toward the resolution of a larger objective.
Multiple mutually-exclusive campaigns should be active at one time, allowing
the player to either participate in, or simply watch a unique timeline unfold
before them. Should the player fail in their aims, the world should not end,
but instead continue to function with the full consequences of their failure.
As the complexity of such a world increases, so does the novelty of each 
gameplay. The competition of two active plot nodes acts as a unique plot node
in of itself, meaning that the same number of plot nodes in such a procedural
system can offer a geometric improvement in novelty over linear storytelling.

This file contains ideas that simply don't fit within the current scope of
development. This file serves to collect ideas to consider when the current ones
are implemented and the project is ready to grow.



**********************************************************************
        Features
**********************************************************************


**Kingdom**
Port in the Kingdom card game as a minigame.

## Crafting
Create menu for turning ingrient items into product items.

## Building
Allow Actors to convert collected resources into placeable structures.

## Quests
Allow starting and completing quests.


## NPC interactions

**Dialogue system**
Allow players to traverse speech trees with NPCs with optional voiceovers.

**NPC trading**
Allow dialogue options to trigger trading menu.

**Followers**
Allow player to have a couple NPC followers that maintain a distance from the
player, assist in combat, and help carry items.

**Squads**
Allow player to command a set of NPC squad leaders that each have minions.
Orders would include Move, Attack, Change Rules of Engagement, and Change Pace.

## Survival elements
**Hunger/Thirst**
Require food/water to survive. Possible add auto-consume option with "You have
X days worth of supplies left" warnings to keep this from being tedious.

**Generate map**
Generate a 2D map of the world's terrain so that places that are not loaded 
can still be viewed in detail.

**Command map**
Use 2D map to set navpoints and view a squad's calculated path.

## Vehicles
A vehicle allows faster travel in order to avoid walking on foot. Additionally,
vehicles can provide armor or movement for the purpose of combat. Vehicles hold
Actors and items in seats and cargo containers.

**Mounted Animal**
A horse or similar animal would move similarly to an actor, albeit faster and
capable of climbing greater slopes.

**Automobile**
A wheeled vehicle that moved quickly on smooth roads are more slowly along
grass and sand depending on the tires and suspension. Must be refueled with oil
often.

**Armored vehicle**
Either a tank or armored personnel carrier, the common thread is armor covering
a vehicle with a heavier frame that is intended to withstand small arms fire.
A tank features heavy weaponry whilst an armored personnel carrier focuses on
speed and the delivery of passengers. 

**Airship**
Slow and held in the air by arcane technology, airships are essentially floating
fortresses capable of hauling large cargos. This is often utilized either in
military or trade contexts. Airships are vulnerable in both their power sources
and their propulsion systems, which are needed to keep them in the air. Due to a
lack of gliding, airships will undergo freefall if their propulsion is disabled
and cannot land gracefully in emergencies. The same tech that keeps airships 
in flight is often used to produce force fields and shields. 

**Gravjet**
A gravjet applies the arcane propulsion of Airships to a small, aerodynamic
chassis. Speed and maneuverability trump capacity, meaning that gravjets can
be kept in the air with significantly less mana than their bulkier counterparts.
In addition to the breakneck pace of the arcane propulsion systems, a gravity
stabilization field inside the cockpit allows the vehicle to pull maneuvers that
would otherwise create fatal G-forces for conventional aircraft. Gravjets can
hover, stop on a dime, and make 90 degree angles without harming the pilot nor
vehicle. 

**Airplane**
Using a mechanical propeller, airplanes stay airborne often by oil-derrived
fuel. Kinetic, incindiary, and explosive weapons are often used. Airplanes are
among the slowest aircraft. They often fall into either fighter, bomber, or 
transport configurations.

**Jetplanes**
Jets are propelled by jet engines, allowing them to move at speeds rivaling 
gravjets. Due to their speed and maximum elevation relative to airplanes, jets
rest at the apex of oil-driven aircraft. 




**********************Conservation of resources*********************************
This is the general idea that renewable resources can be created, but
non-renewable resources can only be found.

**Persistant world**
All Actors/Items/Buildings should persist in their current state. Nothing should
respawn nor despawn when a player is absent. Things do not need to remain 
stationary when left alone, however.

**NPC creation**
Actor should be able to pro-create to produce children(By living in the same
house/den) or venture in from a neighboring inaccessible territory.

**Skeletal world representation**
When unloaded, the world should update a minimal representation of each region
as a set of ecosystems(wandering Actors), and settlements/dens(Sedentary Actors).
Weighted random events and actions should decide resource production/harvest, 
population growth, the outcome of altercations, and the position of NPCs at any
given time.

********************Multiplayer*************************************************

**Multiplayer Sandbox*
Client-Server multiplayer would allow multiple clients to drop in and out of a
persistent world, as is the case in Minecraft.

**Local Co-op**
Player2 could join in using a gamepad. Player2 might play as a follower, squad
leader, or commander(giving orders from a map filled with info).

**Dual-screen multiplayer**
Give Player2 monitor 2, reducing screen-peeking and eliminating split-screen
issues.

**Online Arena Mode**
Standard matchmaking lobby->static map deathmatch arena with rounds. Gamemodes
could vary.

**Horde mode**
Team 1 fights against oncoming waves of NPCs commanded by
team 2. Each completed wave awards points to both sides. Team 1 uses points for
upgrades and turrets whilst team 2 purchases upgrades and additional NPCs.


********************************************************************************
Philosophy
********************************************************************************

** Naming **
A successful name is either short, or can be abbreviated or made into a 
phoenetic acronym. A more successful name captures some fundamental truth about
the game not only as a player experience, but also as a branding legacy.

Angle A
A common approach to naming is to fashion a compound word from a noun and 
descriptor. 

Nouns:
  Mana
  Magic
  Theatre( of war)
  

Descriptors
  Divine
  
Candidte name: manafest


** Pillars of gameplay **


Choice -
There should be a variety of valid play styles. Every problem should be as much
about choosing a solution as it is executing one. Pros/cons should balance each
solution so that it lends itself to a cohesive play style.

Procedural Story -
A fixed chain or tree of plot nodes allows fine-tailoring of cinematic experiences
using hand-crafted gameplay sequences. This project will not have access to the
labor nor creative talent required for such. More importantly, the AAA market
is heavily saturated with this scheme.

Instead, plot nodes should be defined in terms of objectives that can likewise
be pursued and achieved by both human players and NPCs. A campaign should consist
of a series of plot nodes leading toward the resolution of a larger objective.
Multiple mutually-exclusive campaigns should be active at one time, allowing
the player to either participate in, or simply watch a unique timeline unfold
before them. Should the player fail in their aims, the world should not end,
but instead continue to function with the full consequences of their failure.
As the complexity of such a world increases, so does the novelty of each 
gameplay. The competition of two active plot nodes acts as a unique plot node
in of itself, meaning that the same number of plot nodes in such a procedural
system can offer a geometric improvement in novelty over linear storytelling.


** Roadmapping**

# State of development

At the time of this writing this game is being developed by
one person assuming all roles. Godot 3.0.4 Mono is the engine selected 
for this project.

The first iteration of development is completed. This creates room for
two kinds of growth: refinement of existing features and the introduction
of new features. The former includes consists mostly of granular changes
as well as architectural review to reduce complexity. The second introduces
complexity. This balance must be attended to 

# Areas lacking polish
- AI needs to to rely on Util.RayCast and move AI.BoxCast to Util.BoxCast
- AI does not support netcode.
- AI is currently not smart.
- There's no settings menu to configure volume, mouse sensitivity, etc.
- There is only one placeholder Arena map.
- There are no options to configure single or mutliplayer games.
- Items rely on Scenes for initialization.
- Menus use default skin.
- Actors lack humanoid models with animations.
- Lack of item variety. (Currently no apparel, aid, or misc)

# State of development

At the time of this writing this game is being developed by
one person assuming all roles. Godot 3.0.4 Mono is the engine selected 
for this project.

The first iteration of development is completed. This creates room for
two kinds of growth: refinement of existing features and the introduction
of new features. The former includes consists mostly of granular changes
as well as architectural review to reducOptimization will be a priority that will come only after things are feature complete.  However, that might be something worth noting. e complexity. The second introduces
complexity. This balance must be attended to 

# Areas lacking polish
- AI is currently not smart.
- There is only one placeholder Arena map.
- Items rely on Scenes for initialization.
- Menus use default skin and is hideous.
- Actors lack humanoid models with animations.
- Lack of item variety. (Currently no apparel or misc)
- BUG: When a match ends and new match starts, arena is not initialized properly. (Will take significant effort to reproduce. Considering non-critical for the time being.)

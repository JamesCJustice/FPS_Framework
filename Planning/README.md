# Planning

This folder is where [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) are organized.

Due to the unfamiliarity with Godot and the lack of thorough documentation, my work flow will involve looking through these files and selecting tasks to implement, submitting feature branches with completed tasks.

Each file should contain one epic with multiple stories and tasks beneath.

Issues should be moved into their file's completed section when they are done, giving
an idea of progress by glancing at the file.

# Templates

These can be copied and pasted when creating new files.

Title: Treadmill
Components: Core, Network
Body:
A treadmill should allow a player to move around the overworld, maintaining a grid
of terraincells surrounding the player's character.

A treadmill should occupy the same 3D space in order to avoid running into other treadmills.

When two treadmills neighbor one another or share cells, they should move together in
3D space and then separate independently.


Title: Cartographer
Components: Core
Body:
The cartographer creates an overworld to be used in the adventure mode.
Minimally-viable product: create flat plain  with some cubes raised.


Title: Auth service
Components: Network
Body:
The auth service should allow users to create accounts and then log into them once globally for all participating servers.
